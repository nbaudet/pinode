# PiNode

The aim of this project is to make a basic weather station from a Raspberry Pi.

There is a limited support for different temperature and humidity sensors, but it should be pretty easy to [add any sensor yourself](docs/add_sensor.md).

As for now, the following sensors are supported:
- Sense HAT
- DHT11

## Instructions
