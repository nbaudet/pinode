The aim of this project is to make a basic weather station from a Raspberry Pi.

There is a limited support for different temperature and humidity sensors, but it should be pretty easy to [add any sensor yourself](docs/add_sensor.md).

As for now, the following popular sensors are supported:
- [Sense HAT](docs/sensors/sense_hat.md)
- [DHT22](docs/sensors/dht22.md) (AM2302)
- [BME280](docs/sensors/bme280.md)

## Instructions
