# Installation of BME280

## Installation
First, you have to activate the I2C interface, as described in [this tutorial](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2014/11/enabling-the-i2c-interface-on-the-raspberry-pi/). If you activated I2C, you will need to reboot your system.

Install the [BME280](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/BST-BME280_DS001-10.pdf) by executing the following commands:
```shell
# Will install Adafruit's CircuitPython-DHT and Raspberry Pi's GPIO libraries into the virtual environment
(pinode-env) $ python manage.py install_bme280
```

## Troubleshooting
> `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'smbus'`
If you get this error while testing your sensor, you have to delete or rename `pinode-env/lib/<python version>/no-global-site-packages.txt`.
